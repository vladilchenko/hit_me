    GD50 2018
    Pong Remake

    -- Main Program --

    Author: Colton Ogden
    cogden@cs50.harvard.edu

    Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
    paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
    the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.

    Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
    out its bottom corner, for example. In this case, we only need to worry
    about calling out to `push` to handle the resizing. Takes in a `w` and
    `h` variable representing width and height, respectively.

    Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
    is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
    this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our

    changes we make will be applied as fast as possible and will vary
